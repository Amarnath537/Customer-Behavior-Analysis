## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using an end-to-end Business Intelligence(BI) pipeline. The goal is to uncover insights about customer segments, discounts, revenue, and product performance using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.

The Project simulates how a real analytics team processes raw business data, cleans it, stores it in a database, and builds dashboards for decision-making.


## Business Objectives
This project answers key business questions such as:
- What percentage of customers are subscribed?
- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- Which products are most purchased within each category?
- How does customer behavior vary by age group?
- What percentage of purchases receive discounts?
- How should customers be segmented (New, Returning, Loyal)?

## Data Cleaning (Python - Pandas)
The raw dataset was profiled and cleaned using Python:
- Checked column data types
- Detected missing values
- Filled missing numeric values using median (eg, Review rating category-wise instead of global median value)
- Removed duplicates
- Validated age, price, and purchase ranges

This created a production-ready dataset.


## Database Loading (SQLAlchemy + MySQL)
The cleaned dataset was loaded into MySQL using SQLAlchemy:
- Created MySQL connection
- Loaded Pandas DataFrame into MySQL table
- Verified row counts and data accuracy
	
This allowed SQL-based analytics to be performed on structured, reliable data.


## SQL Business Analysis
Key Analytical techniques used:
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Conditional logic (CASE WHEN)
- Window functions (DENSE_RANK)
- Customer segmentation
- Revenue and discount analysis


## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- KPIs:
  -Number of customers
  - Average purchase amount
  - Average review rating
- Visuals:
  - Customer subscription %
  - Revenue & sales by category
  - Revenue & sales by age group
  - Interactive filters (gender, category, shipping type, subscription)
		
This allows business users to explore trends and customer behavior dynamically.


### 💡Key Insights
- Clothing and Accessories generate the highest revenue
- Most customers are non-subscribers
- Young Adults drive the highest revenue
- Discount usage varies significantly across products
- Loyal customers contribute a disproportionate share of sales
